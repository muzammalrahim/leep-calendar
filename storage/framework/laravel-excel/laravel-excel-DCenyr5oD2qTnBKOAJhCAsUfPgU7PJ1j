Speed limits have been with us since 1757, the first of which was passed in Boston. The 55 mile per hour speed limit became the maximum speed limit in the United States for a period of 12 years beginning in 1974 and ending in 1986. It was thought to force fuel economy and came into being after the 1973 oil embargo.  Experts believed the law would force fuel consumption to fall by 2.2%. In reality it only fell between .5 and 1.1%, depending upon the study.

As Sammy Hagar famously states in his song “I Can’t Drive 55” (see below), the double nickel speed limit was not popular, especial on rural highways in western states. In 1987 the US Congress raised the national speed limit to 65 MPH. By the end of 1995, National Highway Designation Act permanently killed the idea of a national speed limit, transferring authority to the individual States.

Conventional wisdom is a few birds escaped from a pet store fire sometime in the 1980s and now they number in the 100s. It’s quite a sight the first time you see them. Parrots are not native to North America, but exotic birds are popular pets and sometimes they get lost, their owners pass away or their owners are forced to give them up. This means they end up in shelters and need to find new homes. Adopt a Rescue Bird Month came about to highlight the fact that animal rescue helps all types of animals, including birds. If your dream is to own a bird, before you purchase from a pet store, check with your local shelter and bird rescue. You just might be able to give a bird the forever home it’s been waiting for.

747,000 Canadians are living with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias today, a number expected to increase to 1.4 million in the next 15 years. 

Three out of four Canadians know someone with dementia. 

Women represent 72 percent of Canadians living with Alzheimer’s. 

For every person with the disease, two or more family members provide care. Women account for 70 percent of family caregivers. 

In 2011 alone, caregivers spent 444 million unpaid hours providing care. That’s the equivalent of $11 billion in lost income or 230,000 full-time jobs. 

Dementia costs the Canadian economy $33 billion per year. By 2040, that figure will skyrocket to $293 billion per year. 

Age is the biggest risk factor for dementia. After age 65, the risk doubles every five years. 

Dementia also occurs in people in their 50s, 40s and even in their 30s. 

Dementia is progressive. Progression varies greatly from person to person and can last between eight to 10 years – or even longer. 

Dementia is fatal. Its causes are not fully known, and there is still no cure or effective treatment to prevent or reverse the disease. 

Dementia is a collective term to describe brain disorders whose symptoms include: decline in memory, reasoning and communication skills; gradual loss in ability to carry out day-to-day activities; and changes in personality and behavior. 

Dementia can be present in the brain for up to 25 years before symptoms appear.

Wassail is a traditional word indicating the drinking to someone’s health, or on Apple Tree Day, drinking to the apple tree’s health. 

Apple Tree wassails are sung to the apple trees and festivities are held in apple orchards on Twelfth Night Eve and Twelfth Night between January 5-6.

Celebrations include creating bonfires in apple orchards, wrapping favorite trees in ribbons, whacking apple trees whilst reciting poetry, drinking hard cider and pouring a portion of the cider on the roots of the trees to encourage a good harvest in the coming year. 

Today it is most common for children to wassail in the apple orchard during the day with non-alcoholic cider. But, for adults it remains a reason to gather around the apple tree with noise makers and instruments (to wake up the trees from their winter slumber), swap stories and drink lots of hard cider…sharing a little with the tree.",Folk Custom.

On this day, women and children under three rise at dawn and head to the local well where they draw water and infuse it with basil or geranium. This is drunk before heading off to the midwife's house. She is bathed by the mothers and presented with a bouquet of geraniums tied in red and white ribbon (symbolizing a healthy child with rosy cheeks). The ribbons are then removed and a silver coin added. These coins and ribbon are then tied to the child born of the midwife, who also receives new socks and shirts. The custom in Bulgaria is that a child is blessed each of its first three years on this day by the midwife to promote a long healthy life.

Backwards Day: January 31,Worldwide,1,31,2021,1,31,2021,44,13,,,,,Daily,Same,,http://blog.hope-education.co.uk/early-years/classroom-ideas-celebrate-national-backwards-day/,,,About Backwards Day,,"Backwards Day is an organic celebration with no sponsor, celebrated worldwide. The basic concept of the day? Do everything in reverse.  Eat dessert first. Call people by their last name. Read a book back to front. Back into your parking space. See how many palindromes you can identify, (words spelled the same forward and back). You get the idea! 

Historically there is something called “Backwards Day,” but there is no specific reason for designating January 31 to observe it. 

The original Backwards Day occurred in the  Julian Calendar (45BC-1582), the predecessor of the modern Gregorian calendar. Day one of the Gregorian calendar is October 15, 1582, (though it would be the mid 1700s before it became the standard in Europe and the rest of the world).  

Because the Sun’s rotation around the earth is just shy of 365 days, the way the Roman’s dealt with this was to shift the calendar backwards one day every 128 years. With the rise of Christianity, this became a problem. Easter is determined by the vernal equinox and over the course of centuries, the Julian calendar caused the vernal equinox to move backwards by 10 days. 

The Gregorian calendar, with its leap year every four years, solved this problem. The Gregorian calendar also assured that the vernal equinox would always fall at the same time every year.","Unofficial Event. No Sponsor.

Bald Eagle Appreciation Days (US-IA): January 16-17,United States,1,16,2021,1,17,2021,2,15,13,51,52, ,Daily,Changes,3rd Weekend Jan,http://www.keokuk.net/tourism/bald.htm,Bald_Eagle_DaysF.jpg,Bald_Eagle_DaysE.jpg,About National Bald Eagle Appreciation Days,,"During the late fall and winter months bald eagles flock to Iowa where it is much warmer than their summer home of Alaska and Canada. In Alaska and Canada the rivers freeze over so over 1,400 bald eagles follow the river south and spend the coldest months of the year along the Mississippi river between St. Paul and St. Louis. The highest percentage live in the area of Keokuk. 

Each year U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Non Game Wildlife programs within the Iowa Department of Natural Resources and Illinois Department of Conservation, Lee County Conservation Board, Keosippi Mall and The Keokuk Area Convention and Tourism Bureau host Bald Eagle Appreciation Days the 3rd weekend of January. Thousands of people flock to Keokuk to view first hand the national symbol of the United States of America in its natural surroundings. 

Bald Eagle Appreciation Days feature many free indoor and outdoor programs including:

 • Hourly seminars featuring live Bald Eagles
 • Lectures
 • Exhibits
 • Films
 • Special events
 • Manned observation areas along the Mississippi Riverfront
 • Spotting scopes available
 • Conservation officials and biologists on hand for questions

Tips for finding and viewing eagles:

The best time to view eagles is in the early morning. This is their prime feeding time when they can be seen soaring and diving for fish, and the colder, the better. When eagles are not feeding they can be seen most often sitting in large, mature trees closer to the river. They are also commonly seen on river ice near openings. Strong binoculars or a spotting scope are usually necessary for eagle viewing unless you are lucky. They are only a few locations where they are not needed.","U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Non Game Wildlife programs ",Keokuk Area Convention and Tourism Bureau ,401 Main Street,Keokuk,IA,US,52632,(319) 524.5599,,Media Relations,http://www.keokuk.net,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Keosippi Mall 300 Main St; Keokuk, Iowa 52632",,Yes,LEEP

Slippery floors in and around the shower stall can cause falls and injuries. In fact, two-thirds of all bathroom injuries treated at emergency departments occurred in the tub or shower, according to a 2008 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

National Bath Safety Month in January is embraced by Moen. The company provides bath safety tips and statistics to educate consumers on the importance of bath safety and how they can make easy, impactful updates to their homes … without sacrificing style.

“We’ve heard so many stories from consumers sharing ways bath safety has made a difference in their lives,” said Chris Nealon, wholesale product manager, Moen.

“How a shower seat helped a pregnant mom avoid slipping while shaving. An athlete with a broken leg who could shower without assistance … thanks to a grab bar. How a grab bar with shelf helped a grandparent feel secure while bathing – and provided a spot to store bath toys for visiting grandkids. 

It’s these stories and more that inspired the 'My Bath Safety Story' promotion. 

By creating an avenue for homeowners to share their stories, we hope we’ll inspire others to incorporate bath safety products into their bathrooms, no matter their age or level of physical fitness. Bath safety really is important for anyone at any age.

This book changed the way American families cook. It was written in a teaching format rather than simply recipes. It is possible that the day chosen for Blond Brownie Day coincides with the date of release for the book. We are unable to confirm that though. 

It wouldn’t be until 1898 that the words chocolate and brownie would finally appear together in an advertisement in the Kansas City Journal, and 1899 before a chocolate brownie recipe would be published.
 
Blonde brownies contain zero chocolate and are basically cookies baked in a pan and cut into rectangles.  

Today we often do this with chocolate chip cookie dough in an effort to shorten the amount of time it takes to cook the cookies one sheet at a time. Technically, these pan chocolate chip cookies would be brownies.

The 18th Amendment forced Americans who enjoyed libations overseas to find relief from prohibition. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world a revolution was in full swing. People escaping Russia brought with them their favorite distilled spirit. Both groups of refugees converged in Paris.  

During this time Harry Mac Elhone built an authentic New York bar in Paris, complete with the original bar shipped in from the States. The French found this novelty delightful. Americans sought it out as a taste of home and the Russians, well, they just wanted to have a good time.  

Mac Elhone found vodka to be rather tasteless and boring. His bartender Ferdinand “Pet” Petiot spent months fooling around with the liquor, attempting to make something novel. Then one day he combined it with tomato juice cocktail and spices. Bam! The Bloody Mary was born…except it was called Bucket of Blood. Then, the Red Snapper. 

To get to the name Bloody Mary would require the end of Prohibition and a trip back to New York, specifically at the King Cole Bar in the St. Regis Hotel.  Petiot was lured back by the Astors.

There are several stories as to why the Red Snapper morphed into Bloody Mary. Some say it pays homage to Mary Tudor I of England, Queen Elizabeth I’s half sister who was famous for killing Protestants. Or possibly after actor George Jessel friend, Mary Geraghty. Or simply because it was easier to remember than Red Snapper and more appealing than bucket of blood. However, the drink received its name, by 1946 the drink was thus called in print. 

January 1 is dubbed Bloody Mary Day simply because on New Years Eve, people tend to drink too much and thus need this hangover cure, first thing in the morning.

Braille was a Frenchman who lost his sight at a very early age. Braille learned to read using the Haüy system using Latin letters embossed on thick paper or leather. 

The Haüy system was difficult and didn’t allow for writing. Frustrated with it, Braille came up with a new code when he was only 15 years old. This system of dots in small rectangular blocks was far easier to read by touch. More importantly, it allowed for writing. 

Today Braille’s original code exists in several variations that accommodate different languages.

The European Union was created in 1958 and became an economic block in 1999 with the creation of the Euro.  The purpose of the European Union was to promote free trade, ease of movement and economic stability on the European continent. 

Advantages are seen as maintaining sovereignty, limiting immigration of people from war zones and Eastern Europe, protecting British jobs, shoring up the power of the British parliament, and re-establishing Britain as an independent player on the world market.

It is a concentrated effort to stem the tide of lice infections within schools and the general population. The government, through the registered charity Community Hygiene Concern, teaches parents, educators and pharmacists how to detect and stop the spread of head lice and provide affordable Bug Busting kits.

Community Bug Busting Days was started by the late Dr. RJ Donaldson, affectionately known as Paddy. Dr. Donaldson demonstrated in the 1970s that an intensive detection/treatment campaign can dramatically cut the prevalence of head lice. He was the tireless mentor of the Bug Busting Days organized by Community Hygiene Concern, taking a personal interest from 1986 in our development of wet methods of detection in preference to less effective dry or damp methods. Today Bug Busting Days are organized in partnership with the Department of Health.

Lice are a big problem in schools. These parasites, once they infect an individual, can be very difficult to get rid of. The following are some facts: 

The eggs of head lice usually take 7 to 10 days to hatch.

Combing dry or damp hair with a fine-tooth comb is not a reliable way to detect lice.

Metal combs are not suitable for louse detection because these combs are primarily nit combs. Lice caught between the tightly spaced teeth remain unnoticed against the metal and can be combed back into the hair unharmed at subsequent strokes.

There are no studies proving that wet head lice grasp hairs more tightly, thus hampering their removal with a fine-tooth comb.

It is not scientifically proven that head-to-head contact must be prolonged to catch lice - close contact is enough.

Head lice are a community problem. Approximately 20% of head lice cases occur in people over 16 years of age or under 4 years old.",Community Hygiene Concern ,22 Darin Court,Crownhill,Milton Keynes, ,UK,MK8 0AD ,(+44)(0) 19.08.561.928,bugbusters2k@yahoo.co.uk,Media Relations,http://www.chc.org/homedir/contactus.cfm,"<iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/UCoZP5Aso5U"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""640"" height=""360"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/QGvGY72zAqI"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>","<iframe width=""640"" height=""480"" src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/mAsfE8AWxzU"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>",Bug_Busting_46093.pdf,,,Treating Headlice in Children Booklet,,,Bug_Busting_kit_bbkit_001.jpg,,,Bug Busting Kit available at UK Pharmacies,,,,,,,,,LEEP

The legend is that an Arabian traveler accidentally created it when he stored milk in a sheep’s stomach pouch. It separated into curds and whey and he decided he liked it. From Arabia it spread to Europe.  From Europe, it traveled with the pilgrims to the New World.

Baker invented chocolate as we know it today, that is, in a form that could easily be cooked.  In 1764 Mr. Baker placed beans between millstones and ground them down to dust.  This powder could then be mixed with liquids or solids to change the flavor, the same way you add salt or other seasonings.  However, this process was quite expensive, so only the wealthiest people could afford it.  By the early nineteenth century (1828) Conrad Van Houten developed a method for extracting the cacao liquor from the fat in the cocoa bean.  This made chocolate an affordable ingredient and its popularity took off. 

Devil’s Food cake by the Pittsburgh based Duff Company was the first chocolate cake mix. However, WWII got in the way and at the end of the war Duncan Hines and General Mills burst on the scene with their mixes and took nearly half the market between them. 

By the millennium, artisan chocolate cakes, those without flour and closer to the consistency of fudge brownies with less sugar became the rage.

The idea of covering fruits, nuts and even nougat with chocolate wasn’t really possible until the 19th Century. The technology needed to separate the chocolate from cocoa butter wouldn’t be invented until 1828 by Conrad Van Houten in today’s Netherlands. Without this process, chocolate could only be used as a spice, much the same way you would use cinnamon or ginger.

Fortunately, the process was developed and further techniques, including conching, invented by Rudolph Lindt in 1879 would eventually lead to that box of chocolates everyone loves to get.

The other is in February 25. Their are several varieties of clam chowder, the most common being  New England (white sauce), Manhattan (red sauce) and Rhode Island Clam Chowder (clear broth).

Chowder is a cross between a stew and a soup, essentially made of vegetables and fish stewed in a cauldron. Calderia is Latin for a “place for warming things.” Jowter is old English for a “fish peddler”. It is believed that this is the origin of the word chowder. The first recipes for chowder seem originate in both France and England, among the coastal fishing villages. The custom was to have a cauldron of simmering in the house, awaiting the fishing ships return to port. A portion of each man’s catch would be tossed in and the resulting chowder was served to the community to celebrate the safe return of the ship.

Clams were an easy choice, and could be gathered without the need to go out in a ship. This made them ideal for chowder, especially when the weather was bad. Of course clams could only be harvested at certain times of the year, so the chowder was often made from haddock, cod or other local fish. Chowder was a staple of the working classes.

Later recipes for chowder included other meats like ham, bacon and poultry. Clam chowder became a favorite with East Coast Americans, especially on Fridays due to a Christian custom of only eating fish on Friday.",Unofficial Event. No Sponsor.

Confederate Heroes Day (US-TX)(1807): January 19*,United States,1,19,2021,1,19,2021,3,29,59,36,52,,Daily,Same,,http://www.hr.sao.texas.gov/compensation/Holidays2016_2017.pdf,,,About the Confederate Memorial Day in Texas,,"Confederate Memorial Day is celebrated in most of the former states of The Confederacy on different days of the year. In some cases like Georgia, it is no longer referred to as Confederate Memorial Day, rather as 'state holiday'. It is an official state holiday in most and honors the men who died fighting for The Confederacy during the American Civil War, 1861-1865. 

Dates are as follows: 

Alabama, Georgia: 4th Monday in April 

Mississippi: Last Monday in April

Florida: April 26; 

Tennessee, Kentucky & Louisiana: June 3, Jefferson Davis's birthday 1808

North & South Carolina: May 10, Anniversary of the death of General ""Stonewall"" Jackson in 1863

Texas: January 19, Birthday of Robert E. Lee 1807; 

Due to the 400 year legacy of slavery (ending in 1865) and state supported racial segregation (ending in 1964), this event is highly contentious and seen as a celebration of racism by many critics. Detractors insist this plays into existing racism and celebrates white supremacy and slavery.

Proponents for the observance month insist that the Confederacy played a part in shaping who we are and the ramifications as well as contributions continue today. To deny a portion of our past, good and bad, is selective censorship. This month can also be used to explore the unspoken but oft felt prejudices and perceived reality that political correctness squelches. 

Whether you side with the detractors or the proponents, the best way to acknowledge this month is to spend some time reading the actual Constitution of the United States and learning history. History, not social studies. A great place to start is with Howard Zinn’s Peoples’ History of the United States, which some states, including Arizona, have tried to ban from their schools.  Why? Because it is a history of the American people, not the leaders and looks at the nation from the perspective of the 99%, the immigrants, migrant workers, women, religious minorities, slaves, the common man.""",Historical Anniversary.

Croissants' first appear in 1683 in Austria, so the legend goes. At that time, the Ottoman Empire besieged Vienna, Austria. The Austrians won the siege and are said to have celebrated their victory over the Islamic empire with crescent shaped pastries in honor of their victory. Why a crescent? It’s the symbol of Islam…or is it?

Here’s the problem with that legend. 

The crescent and star were not associated with Islam until the late 1700s when the Ottoman Empire emblazoned their flag with the symbol. Prior to that, there was no universal symbol for Islam like the cross or fish in Christianity. The Star of David, likewise, is not an ancient symbol for Judaism. It was adopted by the Zionist movement at the turn of the last century and represents a political movement, not a faith. 

The star and crescent symbol can be found on artifacts dating back to the Bronze age. It is on Roman coins, within the symbols of the Knights Templar and various Christian iconography. So if the legend about 17th century bakers in Austria is incorrect, where did croissants come from? 

Croissants are the children of a 13th century bread called the Kipferi, which is a crusted yeast bread baked in a 3/4 circle. The baking style required to make a croissant incorporates layers of yeast bread with butter folded on top of each other, then twisted. This technique first appeared on the scene in the late 1830s in France at Austrian baker August Zang’s Pastry shop in Paris, the Boulangerie Viennoise. The Austrian took his light layered creation and folded its ends toward each other forming the now iconic crescent shape of this delicious bread. By 1869, the croissant made its way to breakfast tables throughout France and had become a staple. The puff pastry received one more boost in popularity when Charles Dickens included a mention of it within his periodical All the Year Round in 1872.

Now you know the brief history of one of the world’s favorite breads, the croissant and the origins of religious trademarks. With today being Croissant Day, why not indulge in one yourself!",Unofficial Event. No Sponsor.

"Daylight Savings (FJ, TO), Ends: January 17",Fiji & Tonga,1,17,2021,1,17,2021,15,30,4, ,,,Daily,Changes,3rd Sunday of January,http://www.worldtimezone.com/daylight.html,,,About Daylight Savings in Fiji & Tonga,,"Daylight Savings in Fiji & Tonga commences on the 1st Sunday of November (Spring Forward) and ends on the 3rd Sunday of January (Fall Back).

On this day we move the clock one hour ahead at 2AM in November or one hour back in January at 2AM in the morning on Sunday. 

The saying, “spring forward, fall back” is a good way to remember. This works in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres as the seasons are reversed.

Benjamin Franklin was the first to propose daylight savings time in 1784. Modern DST was established in 1895. Throughout history there were several variations ranging from 30 minutes to two hours. 

Not everyone observes DST, which can make setting appointments very challenging. The main purpose of DST is to make better use of daylight hours for farming, early morning activities (such as children walking to school in the light instead of dark) and saving energy. 

The closer one lives to the North and South Pole, the longer the period of daylight in the summer months.

Hazardous child labour was most prevalent among children aged 15 to 17. Nevertheless, up to a fourth of all hazardous child labour (19 million), was carried out by children under the age of 12.

Almost half (48 per cent) of the victims of child labour were aged 5-11 years; 28 per cent were 12-14 years old; and 24 per cent were 15-17 years old.

Child labour is concentrated primarily in agriculture (71 per cent) – this includes fishing, forestry, livestock herding and aquaculture – 17 per cent in services; and 12 per cent in the Industrial sector, including mining.""

2. Invites all Member States, organizations of the United Nations system, other international and regional organizations and civil society, including non-governmental organizations, individuals and other relevant stakeholders, to observe the International Year, as appropriate, through activities aimed at raising awareness of the importance of the eradication of child labour, and to share best practices in this regard;

3. Invites the International Labour Organization, mindful of the provisions contained in the annex to Economic and Social Council resolution 1980/67, to facilitate the implementation of the International Year;

4. Stresses that the cost of all activities that may arise from the implementation of the present resolution and that are above and beyond those currently within the mandate of the lead agency should be met through voluntary contributions;

It was popularized by Dr. James Caleb Jackson, Dansville, New York as a way to improve digestion. 

The name was later changed to granola by Kellogg to avoid a legal dispute when Kellogg began creating a similar baked cereal.  Granola is baked.  Muesli, which is similar, is raw.

By the early 20th Century, Granola slipped from favor.  But oats and muesli were already being used to create cereal bars called Flapjacks in the United Kingdom and muesli bars in Oceania.  These were considered desserts and very similar to today’s mass produced bars.

The flower children of the 1960s would revive it, pimping it up with dried fruits and a variety of nuts.  The ancient food, now marketed as a health food and a popular alternative to fast food on the go, was set to explode onto the market.

The addition of the granola bar (basically a cookie in bar form and marketed as healthy) soon entered the snack and breakfast market during the mid 1970s to early 1980s. Today they are one of the most popular adult ‘sweets’ and often used as meal replacements.",Unofficial Event. No Sponsor., , , , , , , , , , ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LEEP

It lays bare insecurities, strengths, personality, proclivities and where they are their life. The study of handwriting is called graphology, and the person who studies it is a graphologist or graphoanalyst. Handwriting is individual to the person and it changes over time.  Consider diary entries you made in your teens, checks you wrote in your early twenties. Go back and take a look at those and see how your own writing has changed.

Increasingly with texting and computers, handwriting, especially cursive, is becoming a lost art. In fact, some schools don't even bother to teach cursive writing, which is a shame. It puts students at a disadvantage, especially in higher education or a business atmosphere. One writes 2-3 times faster in cursive then printing.

To help people recognize the diversity of happiness the Secret Society of Happy People has identified the Thirty-One Types of Happiness:

“Cream as rich as an Irish brogue; 
coffee as strong as a friendly hand; 
sugar sweet as the tongue of a rogue; 
and whiskey smooth as the wit of the land.”

Buena Vista Cafe in San Francisco was the first to serve Irish Coffee on November 10, 1952. Joe Sheridan, a bartender is the mixologist. Stanton Delaplane is the journalist who discovered the drink in Ireland and brought the secret formula back to the US. 

The original Irish Coffee is believed to have been first served at the flying boat terminal in Foynes, Ireland sometime during the winter of 1943.

Midwife's or Women's Day in Greece is held annually. Women of childbearing age get out of the house, dine and pamper and leave caring and cleaning to men for the day. In some smaller villages, men caught outside on this day are greeted with a bucket of cold water splashed at them...and promptly told to return to the house for the rest of the day. 

As most traditions, this day does have ties to the Bible. It's tied to Saint Agia Domnikes, the midwife who is believed to have help the Panagia with the birth of Christ, whose baptism is celebrated on Epiphany in Greece. The Day of Agia Domnikes, or Midwife's Day is celebrated annually two days later. The water ritual evolved from the practice of pouring out water, (in preparation for giving birth) for the selected midwife on this day by fertile women. In olden days, women kissed a sausage or leek and provided gifts for the ceremonial midwife. Today they eat the sausage, drink a lot of wine, eat and at times, douse men in cold water. What fun!",Greek Tradition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LEEP

In most countries, it is a national holiday. Common traditions include attending parties, eating special New Year’s foods, making resolutions for the New Year and watching fireworks displays. 

The earliest recorded festivities in honor of a new year’s arrival date back some 4,000 years to ancient Babylon. 

Emperor Julius Caesar (July 13, 100 BC - March 15, 44 BC) instituted January 1 as the first day of the year, partly to honor the month’s namesake, Janus, the Roman god of beginnings. Janus is always depicted with two faces. These allowed him to look back into the past and forward into the future. Caesar developed the Julian Calendar, which became the calendar of commerce until 1753 when the Gregorian Calendar, created by Pope Gregory XIII, was  finally adopted by the British Empire as the international standard.  

The difference in the two calendars is 11 minutes, which over decades, eventually puts summer in winter and winter in summer!  And Leap Years, to offset for the 1/4 day every four years it takes the sun to go around the earth, these were added into the Gregorian Calendar.  Why change? Predominantly so Easter didn’t fall in the middle of winter and that it would always occur in the spring.

Founded by Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik, authors of the popular web comic Penny Arcade, each PAX is a show dedicated to supporting and celebrating video and tabletop gaming.

Since PAX’s inception, millions of attendees have enjoyed the expo floor halls filled with booths from major game publishers and independent developers, panels from video game industry insiders, game culture-inspired concerts, LAN parties, tabletop gaming, competitions and much more.

HISTORY

In 2004, Penny Arcade established a convention exclusively for gaming, following in the footsteps of comic, anime, and other geek hobbies. That year, a 4,500-person event was held in Bellevue, WA focused around the gaming community. Subsequent years saw the show double in size until venues reached capacity, prompting the creation of the Boston-based PAX East in 2010.

PAX East drew tens of thousands of attendees in its inaugural year and Penny Arcade hasn’t looked back since, quickly expanding to markets around the world while still staying true to the original formula of celebrating all aspects of gaming and game culture.

All televised and venue specific events (sporting, concerts, trade shows, etc.) should be treated as estimated, even if the dates are set. Several factors can cause an event to change dates at the last minute including weather, strikes, natural disasters, political upheaval, conflicting programming and current events. Because of this, always verify the event with the promotor prior to committing resources.

From their 2005 press release on the day:

PONTE VEDRA BEACH, FLORIDA (PRWEB) DECEMBER 9, 2005
The co-founders of January 2nd's National Personal Trainer Appreciation Day, Jim Labadie and Joey Atlas, know the holidays can be a calorically challenging time of year. To avoid putting on extra weight this season, they advocate starting a fitness plan before the festivities begin.

Most people realize getting more physical activity and eating a nutritious diet of small, frequent and nutritious meals six days a week is critical to keeping weight off. However, to keep ones sanity, especially around the holidays, it's a good idea for people to give themselves one """"cheat"""" or ""guilt-free"" day per week.

Atlas explains, ""The 'guilt-free' day should be one day out of the week when you allow yourself to eat anything you really, really want. During the holidays it is a good idea to have your guilt-free day on either Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, for example. At the same time it's important to understand the splurging must be limited to that one day. Behaving yourself at other holiday functions, such as office parties, will be made easier knowing your day is coming.""

Other tips include:
1-Walking extra laps around the mall when shopping.

2-Taking a 10-minute walk after a large holiday meal to burn calories and improve digestion.

3-Limiting alcohol consumption due to the fact it often leads to making poor food choices.

4-Writing down fitness goals and sticking to them.

5-Having a clear picture in your mind of how great you're going to feel after the holidays having kept the weight off.

The term ‘polka dot’ first appeared in Godey’s Lady’s Book in 1857 describing the pattern on a muslin scarf as “for light summer wear, surrounded by a scalloped edge, embroidered in rows of round polka dots.”

The word 'polka' is a descriptor for Polish women. The pattern of dots on fabric hit its height in the 1930s and 1940s following its debut on Minnie Mouse's dress in 1926. Other popular culture references to the pattern include Marilyn Monroe's 1951 bikini, The song by Brian Hyland ""Its Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini"" and the Marvel comic hero Polka Dot Man.

Cretors owned a confectionary shop in Decatur, Illinois and decided to expand his offerings out onto the sidewalk where people were. He purchased a peanut roaster, but found it lacked functionality. Tinkering, he improved it and added other products. He is the person that created the sidewalk roasters used for peanuts, coffee and popcorn that were commonplace in the late 19th century through WWII. 

It is because of Cretors that you were able to go to the boardwalk, ball game or circus and enjoy roasted peanuts or popcorn, fresh and hot. National Popcorn Day honors his memory.

Popcorn has been around for about 4,000 years, but it wasn’t until 1519 that Europeans would discover it. Cortes got his first sight of popcorn when he invaded Mexico and came into contact with the Aztecs. Popcorn was an important food for the Aztec Indians, who also used popcorn as decoration for ceremonial headdresses, necklaces and ornaments on statues of their gods, including Tlaloc, the god of rain and fertility.

Today it is a favorite snack the world over. Americans consume some 16 billion quarts a year, or 51 quarts per man, woman, and child.

It was ruled 7-2 that a right to privacy under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment extended to a woman's decision to have an abortion. It was a tricky decision because it needed to balance between the state's two legitimate interests - protecting women's health and protecting the potentiality of human life. It was decided that a woman has a right to abort a pregnancy up until fetal viability. Viable is defined as ""potentially able to live outside of the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid.""

A Proclamation
A great education provides students with a foundation to pursue the American Dream of a hopeful and prosperous future. During National School Choice Week, we reaffirm our commitment to enable all students to pursue the education that will best equip them for success in work and life.

Every child deserves the chance to flourish in an educational environment that best leverages their unique learning style, cultivates their talent, and develops the skills needed to succeed in an ever-changing world. Likewise, teachers deserve the chance to innovate in the classroom and do their best work. Yet, today's system often falls short of what students and teachers need and deserve, and often makes it too hard for families and educators to create the best learning experience for each child. The results tell the unfortunate story: recent international surveys ranked the United States 24th in reading, 25th in science, and 40th in math. These results were not the result of incapable children; they were the consequence of the limitations imposed by a largely one-size-fits-all approach to education.

Education should inspire wonder, stimulate curiosity, and spark a lifelong desire in our children to learn and grow. Increased educational options—including through out-of-zone public schools, public charter schools, magnet schools, sectarian and secular private schools, home schools, and online education programs—have expanded opportunities for students regardless of background or economic status. We should all work to ensure all children receive great educations, regardless of where they live, how much their family makes, or how they best learn.

My Administration knows that choice in education plays a vital role in the success of our children and our country. The number of students receiving a D.C. Opportunity Scholarship has increased by nearly 50 percent under my Administration. In last year's enactment of the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we improved 529 plans so that they may cover elementary and secondary school tuition. Family demand for public charter schools has continued to grow. And, importantly, we have encouraged States, local communities, and families to refocus education policy where it belongs—on what is best for each child.

We commend our Nation's families, teachers, school leaders, and all those who nobly dedicate their lives to educating the next generation. My Administration will continue to stand with students and their families in the fight for the best educational opportunities for their children.

As our Nation celebrates National School Choice Week, I encourage families to explore new educational opportunities; I urge educators to develop imaginative and innovative pathways to learning; and I challenge students to passionately pursue their goals and dreams with discipline, integrity, and unyielding determination. Lastly, I urge lawmakers in Congress and in the States to embrace and expand education choice, which will strengthen our students, families, educators, communities, and ultimately, our great Nation.

This day marks the anniversary of the creation of The Seeing Eye on January 29, 1929, the organization that pioneered seeing eye dogs. 

Usually seeing eye dogs are Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers or German Shepherds, since these are some of the most intelligent breeds and capable of complex training. Additionally, these breeds tend to be calm and focused, as well as friendly and loyal. 

Dogs have been companions of humans with disabilities since ancient Roman times, and there are records of dogs leading the blind during that era. 

The first attempt to train a dog to be the eyes of a human being occurred in Paris in 1780 at the school for the blind. 

In 1788 Josef Riesinger, blind himself, successfully trained his Spitz to be his helper in Vienna, Austria. 

Guide dogs for the blind didn’t really take off until 1927 when an article was published in the Saturday Evening Post by Dorothy Eustis about her efforts training dogs for the blind. It was relayed to Morris Frank, himself blind. Together Eustis and Frank went to Switzerland and trained the first official seeing eye dog, Buddy. They established a school in Switzerland to train more dogs in 1928. Buddy was introduced to The Seeing Eye in Morristown New Jersey in 1929, and from there, seeing eye dogs grew in popularity and utility.",Historical Anniversary.

The dish originated in Italy and on the island of Sicilia. 

The first possible mention of a Spaghetti type dish occurs in the 12th Century book by Abu Abdullah Mohammed al Idrisi, 'The Book of Roger'. In it he details the culture and cuisine in various areas of the Mediterranean, most notably in the town of Trabia on the island of Sicily. Here, using hard wheat, the natives made a dough in long strands that they then exported to other areas.  The book was written nearly a century prior to Marco Polo’s exhibitions to the Far East. It is believed this first form of spaghetti could have been what we refer to as vermicelli today.  In Italian, that word means ‘thin worms’ in Italian. Either way, today is the day to celebrate spaghetti, with or without marinara sauce.  Enjoy!

""Unfortunately, many Americans live on the outskirts of hope -- some because of their poverty, and some because of theft color, and all too many because of both. Our task is to help replace their despair with opportunity.

This administration today, here and now, declares unconditional war on poverty in America. I urge this Congress and all Americans to join with me in that effort.

It will not be a short or easy struggle, no single weapon or strategy will suffice, but we shall not rest until that war is won. The richest Nation on earth can afford to win it. We cannot afford to lose it. One thousand dollars invested in salvaging an unemployable youth today can return $40,000 or more in his lifetime.

Poverty is a national problem, requiring improved national organization and support. But this attack, to be effective, must also be organized at the State and the local level and must be supported and directed by State and local efforts.

For the war against poverty will not be won here in Washington. It must be won in the field, in every private home, in every public office, from the courthouse to the White House.""

The war continues to this day with over 45 million people (15%) still living below the poverty line in the United States according to the latest census report in 2014.
