The first TED included a demo of the compact disc, the e-book and cutting-edge 3D graphics from Lucasfilm. Remember, this was 1984 - the World Wide Web would not be created until 1991 and smart phones would not exist until 2007! \n\nAlso presenting was mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot who demonstrated how to map coastlines using his developing theory of fractal geometry. \n\nTED lost money that first year and it would take another six before Wurman would give it another shot by partnering with Harry Marks. \n\nSecond time around he struck gold and the TED conference quickly became one of the most anticipated annual events in intellectual and creative circles. At the time it was held in the seaside town of Monterey, California. Over the years it expanded its areas of coverage, bringing in the brightest minds from multiple industries and areas of expertise. By 2000, TED expanded and went non-profit. \n\nIn addition to the original TED Conference, the non-profit has added the following events services:\n\n â¢ TEDGlobal, held in locations around the world\n â¢ TED Prize, which grants its winners one wish to change the world\n â¢ TED Talks, an audio and video podcast series\n\nAttendance at a TED conference is by application.

Kennedy.\n\nOn June 5, 1968, Senator Kennedy was exiting a speech and thanking his supporters in the Ambassador Hotel of Los Angeles when Sirhan Sirhan, approached him with a rolled-up poster concealing a .22 caliber revolver. Sirhan then shot the senator at close range with three shots, injuring bystanders and the Senator. Fatally wounded, the senator was rushed to the hospital but was declared dead the next day. He was 42 years old. Two days later, he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nThe day also has significance in Palestinian culture, which is why June 5 may have been chosen as the date.

Despite that stateâs attack on the USS Liberty (killing 34 and wounding 171 on June 8, 1967), the United States continues to shield its ally from international law, condemnation, military and political consequences for its ongoing subjugation and occupation. June 5, 1967 was the last day of freedom for millions of Palestinians, something that would not be possible without US support.

It had a problem though. It wasnât accurate. Every year it was off by 11.5 minutes. Over the course of centuries, 11 minutes per year can add up. The Julian Calendar has 13 fewer days than the Gregorian and doesnât follow a complete solar rotation of the earth.\n\nThe Gregorian calendar addressed this issue and split time into two eras: before the birth of Jesus Christ (BC) and after the nativity (AD).  Of course non-Christian religions didnât like this so they changed it to Before the Common Era and Common Era.  No matter what you call it, the demarcation point is still the same: the Birth of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe Julian Calendar is still used by Orthodox Christians as their religious calendar, which is why youâll find two different celebrations of Easter and Christmas each year.  Other religions use their own calendars, most of which follow the movements of the sun, moon and/or stars.  These calendars are shorter than the Gregorian Calendar, which is now the international standard. \n\nThe oldest calendar in the world is the Byzantine Calendar, which has been marking time over the past 7,500+ years.\"', 'Statistical Event.

The student survivors are now in their 40s. \n\nWhen did school shootings start?\n\nOn November 12, 1840, University of Virginia law student Joseph Semmes shot and killed his professor John Anthony Gardner Davis. That is the first known school shooting in the US. \n\nThe first known school shooting at an American K-12 school occurred in 1853. Teacher William Butler was murdered by former student Matthews F. Ward. Ward was \'defending\' his brother\'s honor after he had been disciplined the day before. \n\nUntil the 1960s, school shootings were usually individual disputes with 0-2 fatalities, like the above. This changed on August 1, 1966, when a gunman climbed onto the observation deck at the University of Texas at Austin. For the next 96-minutes, he picked people off as a sniper, killing 17 and wounding 31.\n  \nCanada experienced its Columbine ten years prior at Ãcole Polytechnique, where 14 women were killed. England saw 18 killed at Dunblane in 1996\n\nColumbine heightened awareness of school shootings in the United States. Since, school shootings have become more frequent in the United States, which leads the world in school shootings. Some of the worst school shootings in history include Beslan (RU), Sandy Hook (USA), Virginia Tech (USA), Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School (USA), Erfurt (DE), Winnenden (DE), Realengo, (BR), and the Azerbaijan State Oil Academy (AZ).\n\nThe two worst individual school shooting are:\n\nTaliban attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar, Pakistan on December 16, 2014. With guns and grenades they killed 145 people. \n\nAl-Shabaab attack on Garissa University College in Garissa, Kenya, April 3, 2015. 147 people were killed. \n\nHave School shootings increased?\n\nDuring the 1970s, there were 29 school shootings, the worst being Cal-State, Fullerton with seven dead and two injured. Between 1980 & 1989, there were 40 shootings at schools. In the 1990s there were 63, including Columbine. Between 2000 and 2009, another 60 school shootings occurred. \n\nBetween 2010 and June 2018, the number of school shootings in the United States had reached 165. At this writing, there is still 18 months to go in this decade. If the trend continues, school shootings will have increased more than 300% over the past ten years. ', 'Historical Anniversary.

St. Helens Eruption', NULL, 'Today is the 45th anniversary of the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens. This Plinian eruption was in the same category as the infamous Mt Vesuvius eruption of 79AD and ranked five on the Volcanic Explosivity Index. That index measures volcanos on a scale of 1-7. Seven would match the volcanic eruption 600,000 years ago that created the Yellowstone Caldera and covered over 100 cubed kilometers. By contrast, Mt. St. Helens blew out 1 cubed kilometers. \n\nThe blast cloud traveled as far as 17 miles northward from the volcano and the landslide traveled about 14 miles west down the North Fork Toutle River. \n\nPrevailing winds blew 520 million tons of ash eastward across the United States and caused complete darkness in Spokane, Washington, 250 miles from the volcano. Fifty-seven people lost their lives as a result of the eruption, in addition to over 7000 big game animals and around 12-million salmon. \n\nPersonal note from Laura:\nMy family had just moved to Portland, Oregon from the Silicon Valley in January of 1980, when in February and March, rumblings began to be heard on the mountain.  We traded earthquakes for volcanos it seemed. On May 18th, the mountain completely exploded. You could see the cloud from Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon.\n\nThat first major explosion blew east, rather than west where we lived. For weeks following it one could follow the ash cloud spread in a large funnel shape from its origin, over the Rockies and into the Dakotas.  The cloud was so large and dense in ash, it could be clearly seen from outer space. \n\nI remember my father loading us in the FIAT and taking us to the top of Skyline Drive, which runs along the hills separating where we lived from the city of Portland and the Willamette River.  It seemed to go on and on, as high as the eye could see. The mountain seemed to cough up billow after billow of gas and hot ash.  Weâd never seen anything like it. The entire top of the mountain, we would later discover, had been blown off.\n\nOver the next several months the mountain continued to erupt, with the wind not always in our favor. One particular Saturday my parents held a garage sale.  When we walked outside, it looked like it was snowing.  It wasnât. It was ash, falling from the sky and covering it in several inches of grey, flaky dusk. \n\nThat dust got into everything and when it rained, it turned into a thick paste.  We had to walk around for days with monkey masks (disposable medical masks), which as a young teen, I really hated. But, the air was too thick to breathe. One of the aspects I remember fondly was when my father allowed me to help him take apart the engine of the FIAT and clean it. Every part was caked in ash dust. Thank heaven it wasnât as complicated as todayâs engines. It had a manual choke, and no radio.  It was a great learning experience and a great father-daughter project.  Little did I know in a few years, that car would be mine.\n\nFor those of us who witnessed Mount Saint Helens and her eruption, it is something weâll never forget. For us, far away, it was curiosity.  For those close, fifty-seven people lost their lives. Most from inhaling scalding ash. \n\nRound about the 25th anniversary I found myself in Oregon again.  Now in my thirties, I drove my car up to the mountain, which was again open. The forest was beginning to come back.  Animals had returned and for a moment it was difficult to believe the event ever happened. Until, one glanced skyward and saw. A crater where a rounded dome once stood, a mountain top shaved. \n\nOh yes, now, I remember. I remember well.', 'Historic Anniversary.

In 1987 the US Congress raised the national speed limit to 65 MPH.

See how many palindromes you can identify, (words spelled the same forward and back). You get the idea! \n\nHistorically there is something called âBackwards Day,â but there is no specific reason for designating January 31 to observe it. \n\nThe original Backwards Day occurred in the  Julian Calendar (45BC-1582), the predecessor of the modern Gregorian calendar. Day one of the Gregorian calendar is October 15, 1582, (though it would be the mid 1700s before it became the standard in Europe and the rest of the world).  \n\nBecause the Sunâs rotation around the earth is just shy of 365 days, the way the Romanâs dealt with this was to shift the calendar backwards one day every 128 years. With the rise of Christianity, this became a problem. Easter is determined by the vernal equinox and over the course of centuries, the Julian calendar caused the vernal equinox to move backwards by 10 days. \n\nThe Gregorian calendar, with its leap year every four years, solved this problem. The Gregorian calendar also assured that the vernal equinox would always fall at the same time every year.', 'Unofficial Event. No Sponsor.

Both groups of refugees converged in Paris.  \n\nDuring this time Harry Mac Elhone built an authentic New York bar in Paris, complete with the original bar shipped in from the States. The French found this novelty delightful. Americans sought it out as a taste of home and the Russians, well, they just wanted to have a good time.  \n\nMac Elhone found vodka to be rather tasteless and boring. His bartender Ferdinand âPetâ Petiot spent months fooling around with the liquor, attempting to make something novel. Then one day he combined it with tomato juice cocktail and spices. Bam! The Bloody Mary was bornâ¦except it was called Bucket of Blood. Then, the Red Snapper. \n\nTo get to the name Bloody Mary would require the end of Prohibition and a trip back to New York, specifically at the King Cole Bar in the St. Regis Hotel.  Petiot was lured back by the Astors.\n\nThere are several stories as to why the Red Snapper morphed into Bloody Mary. Some say it pays homage to Mary Tudor I of England, Queen Elizabeth Iâs half sister who was famous for killing Protestants. Or possibly after actor George Jessel friend, Mary Geraghty. Or simply because it was easier to remember than Red Snapper and more appealing than bucket of blood. However, the drink received its name, by 1946 the drink was thus called in print. \n\nJanuary 1 is dubbed Bloody Mary Day simply because on New Years Eve, people tend to drink too much and thus need this hangover cure, first thing in the morning.', 'Unofficial Event.

It is a concentrated effort to stem the tide of lice infections within schools and the general population. The government, through the registered charity Community Hygiene Concern, teaches parents, educators and pharmacists how to detect and stop the spread of head lice and provide affordable Bug Busting kits.\n\nCommunity Bug Busting Days was started by the late Dr. RJ Donaldson, affectionately known as Paddy. Dr. Donaldson demonstrated in the 1970s that an intensive detection/treatment campaign can dramatically cut the prevalence of head lice. He was the tireless mentor of the Bug Busting Days organized by Community Hygiene Concern, taking a personal interest from 1986 in our development of wet methods of detection in preference to less effective dry or damp methods. Today Bug Busting Days are organized in partnership with the Department of Health.\n\nLice are a big problem in schools. These parasites, once they infect an individual, can be very difficult to get rid of. The following are some facts: \n\nThe eggs of head lice usually take 7 to 10 days to hatch.\n\nCombing dry or damp hair with a fine-tooth comb is not a reliable way to detect lice.\n\nMetal combs are not suitable for louse detection because these combs are primarily nit combs. Lice caught between the tightly spaced teeth remain unnoticed against the metal and can be combed back into the hair unharmed at subsequent strokes.\n\nThere are no studies proving that wet head lice grasp hairs more tightly, thus hampering their removal with a fine-tooth comb.\n\nIt is not scientifically proven that head-to-head contact must be prolonged to catch lice - close contact is enough.\n\nHead lice are a community problem.

The other is in February 25. Their are several varieties of clam chowder, the most common being  New England (white sauce), Manhattan (red sauce) and Rhode Island Clam Chowder (clear broth).\n\nChowder is a cross between a stew and a soup, essentially made of vegetables and fish stewed in a cauldron. Calderia is Latin for a âplace for warming things.â Jowter is old English for a âfish peddlerâ. It is believed that this is the origin of the word chowder. The first recipes for chowder seem originate in both France and England, among the coastal fishing villages. The custom was to have a cauldron of simmering in the house, awaiting the fishing ships return to port. A portion of each manâs catch would be tossed in and the resulting chowder was served to the community to celebrate the safe return of the ship.\n\nClams were an easy choice, and could be gathered without the need to go out in a ship. This made them ideal for chowder, especially when the weather was bad. Of course clams could only be harvested at certain times of the year, so the chowder was often made from haddock, cod or other local fish. Chowder was a staple of the working classes.\n\nLater recipes for chowder included other meats like ham, bacon and poultry. Clam chowder became a favorite with East Coast Americans, especially on Fridays due to a Christian custom of only eating fish on Friday.', 'Unofficial Event. No Sponsor.

Croissants\' first appear in 1683 in Austria, so the legend goes. At that time, the Ottoman Empire besieged Vienna, Austria. The Austrians won the siege and are said to have celebrated their victory over the Islamic empire with crescent shaped pastries in honor of their victory. Why a crescent? Itâs the symbol of Islamâ¦or is it?\n\nHereâs the problem with that legend. \n\nThe crescent and star were not associated with Islam until the late 1700s when the Ottoman Empire emblazoned their flag with the symbol. Prior to that, there was no universal symbol for Islam like the cross or fish in Christianity. The Star of David, likewise, is not an ancient symbol for Judaism. It was adopted by the Zionist movement at the turn of the last century and represents a political movement, not a faith. \n\nThe star and crescent symbol can be found on artifacts dating back to the Bronze age. It is on Roman coins, within the symbols of the Knights Templar and various Christian iconography. So if the legend about 17th century bakers in Austria is incorrect, where did croissants come from? \n\nCroissants are the children of a 13th century bread called the Kipferi, which is a crusted yeast bread baked in a 3/4 circle. The baking style required to make a croissant incorporates layers of yeast bread with butter folded on top of each other, then twisted. This technique first appeared on the scene in the late 1830s in France at Austrian baker August Zangâs Pastry shop in Paris, the Boulangerie Viennoise. The Austrian took his light layered creation and folded its ends toward each other forming the now iconic crescent shape of this delicious bread. By 1869, the croissant made its way to breakfast tables throughout France and had become a staple. The puff pastry received one more boost in popularity when Charles Dickens included a mention of it within his periodical All the Year Round in 1872.\n\nNow you know the brief history of one of the worldâs favorite breads, the croissant and the origins of religious trademarks.

That year, a 4,500-person event was held in Bellevue, WA focused around the gaming community. Subsequent years saw the show double in size until venues reached capacity, prompting the creation of the Boston-based PAX East in 2010.\n\nPAX East drew tens of thousands of attendees in its inaugural year and Penny Arcade hasnât looked back since, quickly expanding to markets around the world while still staying true to the original formula of celebrating all aspects of gaming and game culture.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\n\nAll televised and venue specific events (sporting, concerts, trade shows, etc.) should be treated as estimated, even if the dates are set.

To avoid putting on extra weight this season, they advocate starting a fitness plan before the festivities begin.\n\nMost people realize getting more physical activity and eating a nutritious diet of small, frequent and nutritious meals six days a week is critical to keeping weight off. However, to keep ones sanity, especially around the holidays, it\'s a good idea for people to give themselves one \"\"cheat\"\" or \"guilt-free\" day per week.\n\nAtlas explains, \"The \'guilt-free\' day should be one day out of the week when you allow yourself to eat anything you really, really want. During the holidays it is a good idea to have your guilt-free day on either Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, for example. At the same time it\'s important to understand the splurging must be limited to that one day. Behaving yourself at other holiday functions, such as office parties, will be made easier knowing your day is coming.\"\n\nOther tips include:\n1-Walking extra laps around the mall when shopping.\n\n2-Taking a 10-minute walk after a large holiday meal to burn calories and improve digestion.\n\n3-Limiting alcohol consumption due to the fact it often leads to making poor food choices.\n\n4-Writing down fitness goals and sticking to them.\n\n5-Having a clear picture in your mind of how great you\'re going to feel after the holidays having kept the weight off.\n\nThe website no longer exists for this event and it is currently unsponsored.\"\n ', 'Currently Unsponsored.

During National School Choice Week, we reaffirm our commitment to enable all students to pursue the education that will best equip them for success in work and life.\n\nEvery child deserves the chance to flourish in an educational environment that best leverages their unique learning style, cultivates their talent, and develops the skills needed to succeed in an ever-changing world. Likewise, teachers deserve the chance to innovate in the classroom and do their best work. Yet, today\'s system often falls short of what students and teachers need and deserve, and often makes it too hard for families and educators to create the best learning experience for each child. The results tell the unfortunate story: recent international surveys ranked the United States 24th in reading, 25th in science, and 40th in math. These results were not the result of incapable children; they were the consequence of the limitations imposed by a largely one-size-fits-all approach to education.\n\nEducation should inspire wonder, stimulate curiosity, and spark a lifelong desire in our children to learn and grow. Increased educational optionsâincluding through out-of-zone public schools, public charter schools, magnet schools, sectarian and secular private schools, home schools, and online education programsâhave expanded opportunities for students regardless of background or economic status. We should all work to ensure all children receive great educations, regardless of where they live, how much their family makes, or how they best learn.\n\nMy Administration knows that choice in education plays a vital role in the success of our children and our country. The number of students receiving a D.C. Opportunity Scholarship has increased by nearly 50 percent under my Administration. In last year\'s enactment of the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we improved 529 plans so that they may cover elementary and secondary school tuition. Family demand for public charter schools has continued to grow. And, importantly, we have encouraged States, local communities, and families to refocus education policy where it belongsâon what is best for each child.\n\nWe commend our Nation\'s families, teachers, school leaders, and all those who nobly dedicate their lives to educating the next generation. My Administration will continue to stand with students and their families in the fight for the best educational opportunities for their children.\n\nAs our Nation celebrates National School Choice Week, I encourage families to explore new educational opportunities; I urge educators to develop imaginative and innovative pathways to learning; and I challenge students to passionately pursue their goals and dreams with discipline, integrity, and unyielding determination. Lastly, I urge lawmakers in Congress and in the States to embrace and expand education choice, which will strengthen our students, families, educators, communities, and ultimately, our great Nation.\n\nStart Printed Page 362\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

It was relayed to Morris Frank, himself blind. Together Eustis and Frank went to Switzerland and trained the first official seeing eye dog, Buddy.

In it he details the culture and cuisine in various areas of the Mediterranean, most notably in the town of Trabia on the island of Sicily. Here, using hard wheat, the natives made a dough in long strands that they then exported to other areas.  The book was written nearly a century prior to Marco Poloâs exhibitions to the Far East. It is believed this first form of spaghetti could have been what we refer to as vermicelli today.  In Italian, that word means âthin wormsâ in Italian. Either way, today is the day to celebrate spaghetti, with or without marinara sauce.

Families travel far and wide to be together, special foods are prepared with the night before the Chinese New Year called the âreunion dinnerâ being the most important.  And  of course, the  retailers have many specials leading up to and during the festivities.

This time is about celebrating. \n\nEach day of the Spring Festival has a different activity.\n\nDay 1: Welcoming of the deities with firecrackers, dragon dancing and a vegetarian diet.\n\nDay 2: Married daughters visit their parents\n\nDay 3: Red Mouth Day is used to burn paper as a sign of destroying wrath. It is considered very unlucky to visit or have guests on this day.\n\nDay 4: Dinner hosted by companies and employers. Businesses go back to work. \n\nDay 5: Birthday of the god of Wealth. Firecrackers are shot to insure his favor, good fortune and prosperity in the year ahead.\n\nDay 6: open\n\nDay 7: Everyone becomes one year older, regardless of their actual birthday. Buddhists will avoid meet and others will have a raw fish salad to eat in order to promote wealth and prosperity in the year ahead. \n\nDay 8: Family dinner night, company hosted lunch or dinner, all to celebrate the birth of the Jade emperor. In the hours leading up to midnight, incense are burnt and food offerings are made. Should a family fail to make offerings, the Kitchen god reports their lack of adherence to the Jade Emperor. \n\nDay 9: A Day of Prayers  and offerings to the Jade Emperor.\n\nDay 10: A party is held for the Jade Emperor.\n\nDay 11 & 12: Celebrations and parties continue with lots of food.\n\nDay 13: Vegetarian day to cleanse the stomach and prayers, offerings and various forms of honor are paid to the Chinese god of War, General Guan Yu from the Han dynasty.\n\nDay 14: Open\n\nDay 15: The Shangyuan Festival of lanterns is when people eat traditional Chinese foods like rice dumplings, rice ball soup and candies.

It is a concentrated effort to stem the tide of lice infections within schools and the general population. The government, through the registered charity Community Hygiene Concern, teaches parents, educators and pharmacists how to detect and stop the spread of head lice and provide affordable Bug Busting kits.\n\nCommunity Bug Busting Days was started by the late Dr. RJ Donaldson, affectionately known as Paddy. Dr. Donaldson demonstrated in the 1970s that an intensive detection/treatment campaign can dramatically cut the prevalence of head lice. He was the tireless mentor of the Bug Busting Days organized by Community Hygiene Concern, taking a personal interest from 1986 in our development of wet methods of detection in preference to less effective dry or damp methods. Today Bug Busting Days are organized in partnership with the Department of Health.\n\nLice are a big problem in schools. These parasites, once they infect an individual, can be very difficult to get rid of. The following are some facts: \n\nThe eggs of head lice usually take 7 to 10 days to hatch.\n\nCombing dry or damp hair with a fine-tooth comb is not a reliable way to detect lice.\n\nMetal combs are not suitable for louse detection because these combs are primarily nit combs.

To avoid putting on extra weight this season, they advocate starting a fitness plan before the festivities begin.\n\nMost people realize getting more physical activity and eating a nutritious diet of small, frequent and nutritious meals six days a week is critical to keeping weight off. However, to keep ones sanity, especially around the holidays, it\'s a good idea for people to give themselves one \"\"cheat\"\" or \"guilt-free\" day per week.\n\nAtlas explains, \"The \'guilt-free\' day should be one day out of the week when you allow yourself to eat anything you really, really want. During the holidays it is a good idea to have your guilt-free day on either Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, for example. At the same time it\'s important to understand the splurging must be limited to that one day. Behaving yourself at other holiday functions, such as office parties, will be made easier knowing your day is coming.\"\n\nOther tips include:\n1-Walking extra laps around the mall when shopping.\n\n2-Taking a 10-minute walk after a large holiday meal to burn calories and improve digestion.\n\n3-Limiting alcohol consumption due to the fact it often leads to making poor food choices.\n\n4-Writing down fitness goals and sticking to them.\n\n5-Having a clear picture in your mind of how great you\'re going to feel after the holidays having kept the weight off.\n\nThe website no longer exists for this event and it is currently unsponsored.\"\n ', 'Currently Unsponsored.
