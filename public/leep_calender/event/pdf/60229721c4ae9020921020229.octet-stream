The first TED included a demo of the compact disc, the e-book and cutting-edge 3D graphics from Lucasfilm. Remember, this was 1984 - the World Wide Web would not be created until 1991 and smart phones would not exist until 2007! \n\nAlso presenting was mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot who demonstrated how to map coastlines using his developing theory of fractal geometry. \n\nTED lost money that first year and it would take another six before Wurman would give it another shot by partnering with Harry Marks. \n\nSecond time around he struck gold and the TED conference quickly became one of the most anticipated annual events in intellectual and creative circles. At the time it was held in the seaside town of Monterey, California. Over the years it expanded its areas of coverage, bringing in the brightest minds from multiple industries and areas of expertise. By 2000, TED expanded and went non-profit. \n\nIn addition to the original TED Conference, the non-profit has added the following events services:\n\n â¢ TEDGlobal, held in locations around the world\n â¢ TED Prize, which grants its winners one wish to change the world\n â¢ TED Talks, an audio and video podcast series\n\nAttendance at a TED conference is by application.

Kennedy.\n\nOn June 5, 1968, Senator Kennedy was exiting a speech and thanking his supporters in the Ambassador Hotel of Los Angeles when Sirhan Sirhan, approached him with a rolled-up poster concealing a .22 caliber revolver. Sirhan then shot the senator at close range with three shots, injuring bystanders and the Senator. Fatally wounded, the senator was rushed to the hospital but was declared dead the next day. He was 42 years old. Two days later, he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nThe day also has significance in Palestinian culture, which is why June 5 may have been chosen as the date.

Despite that stateâs attack on the USS Liberty (killing 34 and wounding 171 on June 8, 1967), the United States continues to shield its ally from international law, condemnation, military and political consequences for its ongoing subjugation and occupation. June 5, 1967 was the last day of freedom for millions of Palestinians, something that would not be possible without US support.

It had a problem though. It wasnât accurate. Every year it was off by 11.5 minutes. Over the course of centuries, 11 minutes per year can add up. The Julian Calendar has 13 fewer days than the Gregorian and doesnât follow a complete solar rotation of the earth.\n\nThe Gregorian calendar addressed this issue and split time into two eras: before the birth of Jesus Christ (BC) and after the nativity (AD).  Of course non-Christian religions didnât like this so they changed it to Before the Common Era and Common Era.  No matter what you call it, the demarcation point is still the same: the Birth of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe Julian Calendar is still used by Orthodox Christians as their religious calendar, which is why youâll find two different celebrations of Easter and Christmas each year.  Other religions use their own calendars, most of which follow the movements of the sun, moon and/or stars.  These calendars are shorter than the Gregorian Calendar, which is now the international standard. \n\nThe oldest calendar in the world is the Byzantine Calendar, which has been marking time over the past 7,500+ years.\"', 'Statistical Event.

The student survivors are now in their 40s. \n\nWhen did school shootings start?\n\nOn November 12, 1840, University of Virginia law student Joseph Semmes shot and killed his professor John Anthony Gardner Davis. That is the first known school shooting in the US. \n\nThe first known school shooting at an American K-12 school occurred in 1853. Teacher William Butler was murdered by former student Matthews F. Ward. Ward was \'defending\' his brother\'s honor after he had been disciplined the day before. \n\nUntil the 1960s, school shootings were usually individual disputes with 0-2 fatalities, like the above. This changed on August 1, 1966, when a gunman climbed onto the observation deck at the University of Texas at Austin. For the next 96-minutes, he picked people off as a sniper, killing 17 and wounding 31.\n  \nCanada experienced its Columbine ten years prior at Ãcole Polytechnique, where 14 women were killed. England saw 18 killed at Dunblane in 1996\n\nColumbine heightened awareness of school shootings in the United States. Since, school shootings have become more frequent in the United States, which leads the world in school shootings. Some of the worst school shootings in history include Beslan (RU), Sandy Hook (USA), Virginia Tech (USA), Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School (USA), Erfurt (DE), Winnenden (DE), Realengo, (BR), and the Azerbaijan State Oil Academy (AZ).\n\nThe two worst individual school shooting are:\n\nTaliban attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar, Pakistan on December 16, 2014. With guns and grenades they killed 145 people. \n\nAl-Shabaab attack on Garissa University College in Garissa, Kenya, April 3, 2015. 147 people were killed. \n\nHave School shootings increased?\n\nDuring the 1970s, there were 29 school shootings, the worst being Cal-State, Fullerton with seven dead and two injured. Between 1980 & 1989, there were 40 shootings at schools. In the 1990s there were 63, including Columbine. Between 2000 and 2009, another 60 school shootings occurred. \n\nBetween 2010 and June 2018, the number of school shootings in the United States had reached 165. At this writing, there is still 18 months to go in this decade. If the trend continues, school shootings will have increased more than 300% over the past ten years. ', 'Historical Anniversary.

St. Helens Eruption', NULL, 'Today is the 45th anniversary of the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens. This Plinian eruption was in the same category as the infamous Mt Vesuvius eruption of 79AD and ranked five on the Volcanic Explosivity Index. That index measures volcanos on a scale of 1-7. Seven would match the volcanic eruption 600,000 years ago that created the Yellowstone Caldera and covered over 100 cubed kilometers. By contrast, Mt. St. Helens blew out 1 cubed kilometers. \n\nThe blast cloud traveled as far as 17 miles northward from the volcano and the landslide traveled about 14 miles west down the North Fork Toutle River. \n\nPrevailing winds blew 520 million tons of ash eastward across the United States and caused complete darkness in Spokane, Washington, 250 miles from the volcano. Fifty-seven people lost their lives as a result of the eruption, in addition to over 7000 big game animals and around 12-million salmon. \n\nPersonal note from Laura:\nMy family had just moved to Portland, Oregon from the Silicon Valley in January of 1980, when in February and March, rumblings began to be heard on the mountain.  We traded earthquakes for volcanos it seemed. On May 18th, the mountain completely exploded. You could see the cloud from Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon.\n\nThat first major explosion blew east, rather than west where we lived. For weeks following it one could follow the ash cloud spread in a large funnel shape from its origin, over the Rockies and into the Dakotas.  The cloud was so large and dense in ash, it could be clearly seen from outer space. \n\nI remember my father loading us in the FIAT and taking us to the top of Skyline Drive, which runs along the hills separating where we lived from the city of Portland and the Willamette River.  It seemed to go on and on, as high as the eye could see. The mountain seemed to cough up billow after billow of gas and hot ash.  Weâd never seen anything like it. The entire top of the mountain, we would later discover, had been blown off.\n\nOver the next several months the mountain continued to erupt, with the wind not always in our favor. One particular Saturday my parents held a garage sale.  When we walked outside, it looked like it was snowing.  It wasnât. It was ash, falling from the sky and covering it in several inches of grey, flaky dusk. \n\nThat dust got into everything and when it rained, it turned into a thick paste.  We had to walk around for days with monkey masks (disposable medical masks), which as a young teen, I really hated. But, the air was too thick to breathe. One of the aspects I remember fondly was when my father allowed me to help him take apart the engine of the FIAT and clean it. Every part was caked in ash dust. Thank heaven it wasnât as complicated as todayâs engines. It had a manual choke, and no radio.  It was a great learning experience and a great father-daughter project.  Little did I know in a few years, that car would be mine.\n\nFor those of us who witnessed Mount Saint Helens and her eruption, it is something weâll never forget. For us, far away, it was curiosity.  For those close, fifty-seven people lost their lives. Most from inhaling scalding ash. \n\nRound about the 25th anniversary I found myself in Oregon again.  Now in my thirties, I drove my car up to the mountain, which was again open. The forest was beginning to come back.  Animals had returned and for a moment it was difficult to believe the event ever happened. Until, one glanced skyward and saw. A crater where a rounded dome once stood, a mountain top shaved. \n\nOh yes, now, I remember. I remember well.', 'Historic Anniversary.
